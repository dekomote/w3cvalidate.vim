W3cValidate.vim is a plugin that enables buffer/url validation using the http://validator.w3.org api

== USAGE ==

Copy w3cvalidate.vim file inside plugin directory, source it or restart Vim. Use :W3cValidate to validate
the current buffer, or :W3cValidate "[url_here]" to validate a hosted page.

The validator service url can be changed if you run an instance of it localy by setting  g:w3_validator_url  in .vimrc

The script has API timeout default to 20 seconds. You can change it by setting  g:w3_apicall_timeout  in .vimrc

== TODO ==

Parsing the explanation messages for more verbose output.

Adding more options for doctype switch etc.

== NOTES ==

Needs vim compiled with +python option. Works out of the box on Ubuntu and Ubuntu-derivates.

Thanks to Yegappan Lakshmanan for Scratch.vim http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=664, I got some ideas for the temporary buffer displaying the errors/warnings from this script.
